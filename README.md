## Motivation 
Data Science is one of the fastest growing areas in Computer Science and indeed in the world workforce. The ability to find and analyze large datasets is becoming an important component of many jobs and is in general an important skill for informed citizens. The goal of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to use the pandas package to load and analyze a large interesting dataset of your choosing.

This dataset is published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on data.gov. 

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/monthly-provisional-counts-of-deaths-by-age-group-sex-and-race-ethnicity-for-select-causes

It details the death counts per age group, sex, race/ethnicity for select underlying causes of death.
